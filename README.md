# Watermark removal with generative adversarial networks

Watermarks often consist of a logo being overlaid onto an image. There exist several algorithmic techniques to approach watermark removal. Our project will explore a generative-adversarial based approach, that requires no input other than an image with a watermark.



## Dataset

We will use the following datasets:

__Places365__: [google drive](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html)

__celebA__: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pWEZsZE9oNnFzTm8)

__celebA-HQ__: [website]( https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4qLcYyJmiz0TXY1NG02bzZVRGs)

We plan to collect 50 to 100 categories of watermarks in different patterns(e.g. logos of famous brands or organizations).




## Method

The method involes two techniques: a FCN-based approach for the identification of watermarks in the input and a cGANbased approach for filling out the blanks.





## Evaluation

__PSNR__(peak signal-to-noise ratio)

__SSIM__(structural similarity index)



## Experiments
__Analysis of loss functions__

__Evaluation of discriminator__

__Comparison with state-of-the-art__
